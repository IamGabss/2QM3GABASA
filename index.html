Road shimmer wigglin' the vision<br>
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror<br>
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision<br>
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a<br>
</p>

<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
Sometimes, all I think about is you<br>
Late nights in the middle of June<br>
Heat waves been fakin' me out<br>
Can't make you happier now<br>
Sometimes, all I think about is you<br>
Late nights in the middle of June<br>
Heat waves been fakin' me out<br>
Can't make you happier now<br> </p>


<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
Usually I put somethin' on TV<br>
So we never think about you and me<br>
But today I see our reflections<br>
Clearly in Hollywood, layin' on the screen<br>
You just need a better life than this<br>
You need somethin' I can never give<br>
Fake water all across the road<br>
It's gone now, the night has come, but<br> </p>

<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
Sometimes, all I think about is you<br>
Late nights in the middle of June<br>
Heat waves been fakin' me out<br>
Can't make you happier now<br> </p>

<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
You can't fight it, you can't breathe<br>
You say something so lovin', but<br>
Now I gotta let you go<br>
You'll be better off in someone new<br>
I don't wanna be alone<br>
You know it hurts me too<br>
You look so broken when you cry<br>
One more and then I say goodbye<br> </p>

<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
Sometimes, all I think about is you<br>
Late nights in the middle of June<br>
Heat waves been fakin' me out<br>
Can't make you happier now<br>
Sometimes, all I think about is you<br>
Late nights in the middle of June<br>
Heat waves been fakin' me out<br>
Can't make you happier now<br> </p>

<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of<br>
When you sleep and smile so comfortable<br>
I just wish that I could give you that<br>
That look that's perfectly un-sad<br> </p>

<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
Sometimes, all I think about is you<br>
Late nights in the middle of June<br>
Heat waves been fakin' me out<br>
Heat waves been fakin' me out<br> </p>

<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB">
Sometimes, all I think about is you<br>
Late nights in the middle of June<br>
